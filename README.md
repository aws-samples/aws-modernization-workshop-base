# AWSWorkshop.io Base Workshop 

This is a base workshop. Clone and start from this repo to create your workshop.

## Versions
 * 2.0
    * Initial Release:  
      Overhauled to add prescriptive guidance. Improved readability and ease of use by making the base more templatized.

## Description

This is the base repo for building workshops with AWS. It utilizes the Hugo framework, which involves simple markdown and HTML elements.

In this workshop, you are going to learn how to plan, build, and launch an AWS workshop.

## What is a workshop?

An AWS workshop is a tool used to educate users and end customers on how to leverage partner solutions on their AWS workload. What better way to learn than to let customers get hands-on with building or instrumenting products or services in an actual AWS environment?  

A workshop format is used because it scales well, meaning you can deliver the content and message whenever and wherever the customer happens to be. Whether the customer is at work, home, or at an AWS event, they can get hands-on and learn about building products and solutions.

## High-Level Planning

While creating your workshop, you will want to think about what you want to accomplish and how you want to educate users about your product. Depending on your needs, you will either build a new workshop or use an existing one and modify it as you see fit.

You will want to create a high-level plan for your workshop and determine the problem you are looking to solve. Identifying key concepts that you want the customers to learn about is also ideal. Then, outlining what components and AWS services you are going to utilize is a key step.  

This will play a big role in creating the workflow that your customers will be following along with during the workshop. The workflow should be presented as a story and have an introduction, an educational body, and a conclusion that ties all the pieces together. A cleanup section will follow suit so that the customers can ensure their environments will not be charged after they finish the workshop.  

Determining what kind of event this workshop will be presented at is also important as it will help you have a way to capture leads, which should be the end goal in mind. (More details are covered in the workshop itself.)

## Types of Events
 
Identifying whether your workshop will be a self-paced workshop or an AWS-hosted event will be crucial in your planning as well. If it’s a self-paced workshop, then having highly contextualized sections will be very important as there won’t be anyone there to answer questions.  

Making sure that the workshop itself has all relevant information or that clear references have been outlined for any documentation that will be needed to successfully complete the workshop is crucial to the workshop's overall success.

## Build

In this section, you will be setting up your workflow, editing and building, testing your environments, and publishing the workshop if everything is prescriptive enough. Follow along to learn how to complete all of these tasks. 

## Viewing the Workshop Locally

To view and test your workshop locally before publishing, you'll need to set up your development environment. This allows you to preview changes in real time and ensure everything works as expected.

### Development Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/[repository-name].git
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. **Initialize and Update Git Submodules**  
   The workshop uses Hugo themes as submodules. Initialize and update them with:

   ```bash
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   ```

   If you encounter issues where themes or submodules are not loading correctly, try running the following command to ensure everything is fully updated:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --recursive --remote
   ```

   This command ensures all nested submodules are updated to their latest versions.

   If you accidentally cloned the repository without initializing submodules, you can run the following to initialize and update them in one step:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

### Troubleshooting Submodules

If submodules fail to initialize or update, try these steps:

1. **Verify submodule configuration**  
   Run the following command to list all submodules and check if they are correctly set up:

   ```bash
   git config --file .gitmodules --list
   ```

2. **Remove and re-add submodules**  
   If submodules are still not working, remove and re-add them:

   ```bash
   git submodule deinit -f .
   rm -rf .git/modules/
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. **Check for missing submodules in `.gitmodules`**  
   If errors persist, open the `.gitmodules` file and verify that the submodules are correctly referenced.

4. **Ensure correct repository permissions**  
   If your submodules are private, make sure you have the correct SSH or HTTPS access to pull them.

By following these steps, you can resolve most common submodule issues and ensure that your workshop is correctly set up for local development.

### Start the Local Hugo Server  
Launch a local development server to preview your workshop:

```bash
hugo server -D
```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:1313/`, where you can view your workshop in real time. The `-D` flag ensures draft content is also displayed.

### Working with Workshop Content

When making changes to your workshop content, the local server will automatically refresh to show your updates. This allows you to:

- See how your markdown renders in the browser
- Test navigation between pages
- Verify that images and links work correctly
- Check responsive design on different screen sizes

If you encounter issues with the local preview:
- Ensure all submodules are properly initialized
- Try restarting the Hugo server
- Clear your browser cache if changes aren't appearing

Remember that any changes made locally will need to be committed and pushed to the repository to be reflected in the published version of your workshop.
