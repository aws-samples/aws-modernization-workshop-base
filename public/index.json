Next Section OR Conclusion Heading This paragraph block can be utilized to lead into the next section of the workshop (which might be a conclusion) or be a conclusion itself.\nExample Guidance Content Below Do you require attendees to sign up for things? Introduction In this section, we are going to discuss tasks and concepts like retrieving access tokens and other configurations within some integration services.\nDocker Hub Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team. It is the world’s largest repository of container images with an array of content sources including container community developers, open source projects and independent software vendors (ISV) building and distributing their code in containers.\nCreate a Docker Hub Access Token The pipeline will package the application into a Docker image. It then pushes that image a public Docker Hub image repository so that it will be available to the deployment segment of the pipeline. To push or upload the newly-built Docker image, the pipeline will need an access token to authorize transaction on your Docker Hub account. You will need to create a new access token (https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/) and store it for use in later modules. To create your new access tokens:\nLog in to hub.docker.com Click your username in the top right corner and select Account Settings Select Security \u0026gt; New Access Token. Add a description for your token that indicates where the token will be used, or that sets a purpose for the token Copy the token that appears on the screen and record it in a safe location for use in future modules. Make sure you do this now! Once you close this prompt, Docker will never show the token again and you will have to create a new one Warning: Docker Hub credentials and access tokens must be protected and not shared with unauthorized parties to prevent exposure and unauthorized access.\nNow that you have created and safely recorded your new access token, let’s move to the next section and create a new Snyk Access token.\nSnyk Snyk is an open source security platform designed to help software-driven businesses enhance developer security. Snyk’s dependency scanner makes it the only solution that seamlessly and proactively finds, prioritizes, and fixes vulnerabilities and license violations in open source dependencies and container images.\nCreate Snyk Access Token Visit your Snyk account (Account Settings \u0026gt; API Token section) (https://app.snyk.io/account) In the KEY field, select click to show, then select and copy your API token from the field Paste the token that appears on the screen in a safe location for use in future modules Warning: Your Snyk access token must be protected and not shared with unauthorized parties to prevent exposure and unauthorized access.\nYou can read more about Snyk Access Token from their docs here.\nGreat, you have created and safely stored your newly created Snyk access token, Now, let’s create the Terraform Cloud access token.\nTerraform Cloud Terraform Cloud is an application that helps teams use Terraform together. It manages Terraform runs in a consistent and reliable environment, and includes easy access to shared state and secret data, access controls for approving changes to infrastructure, a private registry for sharing Terraform modules, detailed policy controls for governing the contents of Terraform configurations, and more.\nYou will be using Terraform Cloud to store the Terraform state of the infrastructures your pipeline will provision and deploy using Terraform in future modules.\nCreate Terraform Cloud Access Token Create a `[Terraform Cloud ](https://app.terraform.io/signup/account)` account Create a new '[Terraform Cloud organization ] (https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-getting-started/signup#create-your-organization)' Create a new '[Terraform Cloud workspace ] (https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-getting-started/create-workspace)' named: arm-aws-ecs Click the CLI-driven workflow option In the workspace, click arm-aws-ecs \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; General then enable '[local execution mode] (https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/settings.html#execution-mode)' Go to the '[User Settings section] (https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/users.html#user-settings)' in the Terraform Cloud Dashboard In the User Settings section, Create a new '[Terraform API token] (https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/users.html#api-tokens)' then copy and paste the token in a secure location for later use. Warning: Your Terraform Cloud API token must be protected and not shared with unauthorized parties to prevent exposure and unauthorized access.\nGreat, you have created and safely stored your newly created Terraform Cloud API Token.\n"

There are a few steps to complete to set this up\nCreate a new Cloud9 IDE environment Create an IAM role for your workspace Attach the IAM role to your workspace Configure workshop specific requirements Create a new Cloud9 IDE environment Within the AWS console, use the region drop list to select us-east-1 (N. Virginia). This will ensure the workshop script provisions the resources in this same region.. Navigate to the Cloud9 console or just search for it under the AWS console services menu. Click the Create environment button For the name use circleci-workshop, then click Next step Select the default instance type t2.micro Leave all the other settings as default and click Next step followed by Create environment Info: This will take about 1-2 minutes to provision\nConfigure Cloud9 IDE environment When the environment comes up, customize the environment by:\nClose the welcome page tab Close the lower work area tab Open a new terminal tab in the main work area. Tip: If you don’t like this dark theme, you can change it from the View / Themes Cloud9 workspace menu.\nTip: Cloud9 requires third-party-cookies. You can whitelist the specific domains. You are having issues with this, Ad blockers, javascript disabler, and tracking blockers should be disabled for the cloud9 domain, or connecting to the workspace might be impacted.\n"

Next Section Heading This paragraph block can optionally be utilized to lead into the next section of the workshop.\nExample of content guidance Deploy Without Worry Deployments with Kubernetes? Kubernetes (k8s) is a container orchestration platform allowing organizations to scale their services and workloads quickly. If you are working with containers or microservices, k8s may be a great use case for you. Kubenetes deployments are container image deployments which target k8s-based environments.\nAmazon has released a managed k8s service called Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Amazon EKS helps you provide highly-available and secure clusters and automates key tasks such as patching, node provisioning, and updates. While AWS provides the platform on which to run your containerize applications deploying them in a scalable, repeatable and reliable way is where Harness comes in.\nHow does Harness help with EKS deployments? Harness has first-class support for Kubernetes Resources. Harness can create scaffolding around Kubernetes Resources removing complexities around crafting your own resource definitions that are purpose made for deployments. Harness can offer granular deployment lifecycle support around different Kubernetes Resources supporting canary and blue/green deployments inside Kubernetes.\nWhy is Canary deployment tricky with EKS deployments? Canary Deployments are a progressive delivery pattern for rolling out releases to a subset of users. Canary Deployments can be complex because of the multiple phases and the judgment call of when to promote or rollback a canary. The Harness Platform has smart verification taking away the manual toil in verification and enables seamless Canary Deployments.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Hugo Framework and Markdown Setting Up The Workshop: AWS Hosted Or Self-paced By utilizing the Hugo language localization settings, directing the workshop towards a specific setup can be simplified. The Language setting in the config.toml file will allow you to distinguish between having one option or both. Commenting out one of the languages will hide all files that are related to that setup. By default, only the self-guided setup will be enabled. To enable switching, set disableLanguageSwitchingButton to false in the config.toml. If you want to have only the Event Engine setup, set the defaultContentLanguage at the top of the config.toml file to ee.\nThe Entry Point Of The Workshop And Naming Conventions All modifications should be done to files in the content folder. _index.md serves as the main entry point to your workshop. Adding modules can be done utilizing the format of #_title as a folder within content. By adding a number value to the title, this helps to keep the files structured in parity with the content of the workshop. A good practice for file naming is to have the folder be the module number and the submodule numbers add to that number reflecting their order. For example, the first module is 1_ModuleOne and the submodules would be 11_SubmoduleOne, 12_SubmoduleTwo, and so forth. To ensure the modules and submodules follow the correct structure order, adjust the \u0026ldquo;weight\u0026rdquo; value in the heading of the file to reflect the order you wish to use. Three module examples are included in this template with the second being split based upon the method of setup. The same rules apply for submodules. _index.md will be the entry point of that module. Submodules should be named with the format of {module number}{weight}_{title}.{language}.md. For example, 11_Foreword.md would be the first submodule of module one in the default language/setup. 31_PartnerSetup.ee.md would be the first submodule of module 3 in the EventEngine language/setup.\nWorking With Hugo Markdown and Shortcode The following links will supply you with all the reference documentation about Hugo markdown. For more experienced developers, inline HTML is also an option to add more customization. For example \u0026lt;p style='text-align: left;'\u0026gt; inline will allow you to adjust your text placement.\nMarkdown and Shortcode Resources The following links are your go-to resource for markdown and shortcode reference in building your workshop: Markdown cheat sheet https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet Learn theme markdown https://learn.netlify.app/en/cont/markdown/ Menu extras and shortcuts https://learn.netlify.app/en/cont/menushortcuts/ Using Font Awesome Emoji\u0026rsquo;s https://learn.netlify.app/en/cont/icons/ to help your page pop Adding Images and Static Media Any images and static media to be included in the workshop need to be placed in the static/images folder. The format to display an image is as follows: ![Alternate Text](/images/imagename.jpg) For example, the markdown for this dog is ![An adorable puppy](/images/dog.jpg) and the image is in the static/images folder. Creating Links The format for creating links is [Link Display Text](http://example.com). For example, this link Hugo Framework was created using [Hugo Framework](https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/).\nThe \u0026ldquo;More\u0026rdquo; Menu Section This section of the menu on the left is designed to add additional resources that are related to the workshop but not necessarily part of the workshop itself. To modify these links, edit the sections marked [[menu.shortcuts]] in the config.toml located in the root folder. The \u0026ldquo;name\u0026rdquo; portion will be what is displayed in the menu. The \u0026ldquo;url\u0026rdquo; should be the address of the link. The \u0026ldquo;weight\u0026rdquo; setting will adjust the display order, similar to the other \u0026ldquo;weight\u0026rdquo; settings utilized in indexes and modules mentioned previously.\nEnsuring Pages Appear In Both Setup Versions A shortcut to creating the workshop with different setup versions is utilizing the localization functionality of Hugo. By adding a secondary extension to the filename, this file will be included in the specific version of the workshop. Currently, the base utilizes the format *.ee.md to signify that the page is to be used in the AWS EventEngine setup. Much of the time, the files will be the same as the content only differs at specific points. It is necessary to add them, however, to make sure that the common content is duplicated across both versions. If you wish to change the secondary extension or default version, this can be done in the config.toml file in the heading and [Languages] sections.\n"

An example of content guidance can be found at the bottom of this page.\n**REMOVE:** With the exception of _index.md, the module folders and filenames should be changed to better reflect their content, i.e. 1_Planning as the folder and 11_HowToBegin as the first submodule. Changing the \"weight\" value of the header is ultimately what reflects the order the modules are presented. Next Section Heading This paragraph block can optionally be utilized to lead into the next section of the workshop.\nExample of content guidance Configuring Your Solution While working through the workshop modules, you will progressively build a 3-tier web application by utilizing core AWS services.
