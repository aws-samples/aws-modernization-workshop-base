Think about what you want to accomplish and how you want to educate users about your product.  What is the use case or problem that your product solves for the end user and develop a story around it.  Two things to have in the back of your mind while you think about this: 1. Customers don't buy products they buy solutions to their problems and 2. Make learning fun, have a nice story that can entertain them while educating them at the same time.  We have all sat through those boring click and paste workshops, don't make yours one of them.

### Build new or use an existing workshop?
This decision will come down to the story you are trying to tell.  If your product or solution is a simple integration to a bigger product or story then you might want to consider building onto an existing workshop.  If you have a full story to tell or their is no existing workshop that fits your need then its best to create your own stand alone workshop.

Workshops are meant to evolve, so a good story will be extended by other partners, SA's, and the public.  The workshop is open source and that how it will grow.
