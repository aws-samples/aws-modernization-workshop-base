### High Level Workshop Planning
* Determine the message and what you want the customer to learn. Remember to wrap your story around this so customers find it fun. Example: I want potential customers to learn how easy it is to instrument our testing product into their build pipeline.  
* Think from a high level what components or systems will be needed. These are the building blocks that will save you time when you start to build the workshop. Don't reinvent the wheel. link to content for account creation and other artifacts you will need.  This also goes for applications such as Unicorn store, Java Pet Shops, Wild Rydes, etc...
* Determine the workflow or stages. You are telling a story so you should have an introduction to give people conext, tell them what you plan to accomplish in the workshop, body of the workshop, and conclusion.  Don't forget cleanup as well since customers will more than likely be deploying resources and you want to make sure they are not charged more what is necessary to learn about your solution. 
* Change/Add/Remove content to create the workshop.
* Have a way to capture leads.  We don't provide customer contact information on who launches the workshop.
* Test the workshop.  Have several people go through the workshop to make sure all instructions, artifacts, etcetera are included and working.  
* Work with your PSA contact to publish the workshop.  
* Plan Go To Market events.
